## 1.3.0 (2020-11-28)

Accidental version bump during migration to sourcehut. Sorry about that.

## 1.2.0 (2020-05-06)

Normally, here, all non-CLI packages have sources in ES Modules and are being bundled using Rollup into CJS, ESM and UMD builds. Up to now, I kept the setup in CJS, keeping the file setup the same as some influential people on the npm.

Problem is, eslint plugins are not special snowflakes! We can use ES modules import/export in source files! We can publish UMD builds of them too! Imagine, an online plugin tester web app could show how linting works! UMD build served from npm CDN!

We'll start "Rolling up" this and all upcoming eslint plugins!

### Features

- rebase in ES modules and set up Rollup ([f8f9298](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/commit/f8f929842cc5870fa4fcaf93cc2da2d6ba09466f))
